Requirements:

1. Users can get some cash out of the machine
2. User can put card, and if details are valid, get cash out of it
3. Lot of machines can be there, so soln should be generic


basic impl:

class ATM{
    public:
    void insertcard();
    void readpin();
    void readcard();
    voud validatepin();
    void withdrawcash();
    void eject();
    void canceltransaction();
}

// S AND O violated if it is like this in a single class

Obsv:

// there are lots of states, involved here.
